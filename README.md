An updated version of the paper is available and can be downloaded at `paper_post_rebuttal.pdf`.

The figures from the paper can be found in the `figures/` folder. It contains folders corresponding to each experiments that respectively provide resutls for the Gaussian Toy examples (`toy_models/`), the SBI benchmark examples (`sbibm/`) examples and a real simulator from computational neuroscience (`jrnnm/`). They can be downloaded at `figures.zip`.
